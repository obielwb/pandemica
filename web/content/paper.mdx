## Abstract

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, the world has witnessed unprecedented global impacts, resulting in millions of deaths and ongoing economic, political, and social crises. As new potentially pandemic diseases like monkeypox continue to emerge, the development of effective methods to predict and mitigate the impacts of epidemic outbreaks is increasingly crucial. This study introduces an innovative agent-based simulation model that leverages a neural network-like artificial intelligence algorithm to assign demographic and economic data to each agent, allowing for the simulation of individualized behavioral routines. This new approach enhances the accuracy of current epidemiological predictions by adapting to real-world data and scenarios on a local city scale.

The model is designed to be open-source, highly accessible, and focused on local scopes within municipal health departments, requiring basic epidemiological knowledge for operation on standard computers. Users can input demographic data from censitary agencies, such as the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and specific disease characteristics, which the model uses to simulate disease spread tailored to individual cities. This flexibility allows public health officials to adjust parameters such as mask-wearing and vaccination rates to see their effects on disease dynamics, providing actionable, city-scale insights that can be quickly leveraged to minimize loss of life and optimize resource allocation.

By integrating mathematical, biological, and technological concepts, the proposed model serves as a generic tool for simulating the outspread of respiratory infectious diseases, offering reliable epidemiological reports across various hypothetical scenarios. Already being implemented by health secretariats in Campinas and Bragança Paulista, the model stands as an innovative, go-to tool for public health crisis management, aiming to identify the most efficient ways to navigate public health crises with minimal impact on human life and economic stability.

## Introduction

The world has been suffering from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic since the end of 2019, when the virus began to spread from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, in the People's Republic of China. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the total number of deaths directly and indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (described as "excess mortality") between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, was approximately 14.9 million (ranging between 13.3 million and 16.6 million).

Globally, various prevention and containment measures were implemented, such as social distancing, quarantine, lockdown, and subsequent vaccination (ARBEL; PLISKIN, 2022), significantly mitigating the spread of the virus. With the emergence of new potential pandemic pathologies (JONES et al., 2008), such as the recent monkeypox (SOHAL et al., 2023), for example, there is an opportunity to use technology to implement accurate simulation models (COSTA; PEIXOTO, 2020) to discover preventive and remedial measures to mitigate the human, economic, and social impact caused by pandemics (FU et al., 2021).

Countries like South Korea, for example, integrated digital technology into government-coordinated containment and mitigation processes—including surveillance, testing, tracking of contaminations, and strict quarantine—that may be associated with the early flattening of the COVID-19 case incidence curve in the country (FERRETTI et al., 2020). It is increasingly evident the important role of implementing public health-related technologies and the remarkable discovery of strategies and responses to pandemics in innovative ways (WHITELAW et al., 2020).

This project aims to propose a simulation model based on the theory of cellular agents combined with probabilistic mathematics as a means to simulate populations whose individuals interact virtually, taking into account the aspect of disease spread. To create and validate this model, it is proposed to use the data obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic and the viral characteristics of the disease.

In the proposed model, we argue that it is not only possible to simulate the pandemic scenario, predicting the number of cases and deaths but also to study different containment and mitigation parameters, such as different uses of masks, social distancing, and vaccination, for example. In this way, it is possible to determine how each variable influences the overall pandemic scenario, allowing competent entities to know how each measure contributes to the fight against emerging diseases, and for the population to more clearly understand how their actions affect the pandemic as a whole, in order to better weigh them.

## Research Problem

How to propose a reliable pandemic simulation, incorporating characteristics of the virus and its spread among a population, capable of generating different hypothetical scenarios based on changes in virus mitigation and combat variables, leveraging the most of city-scale data?

## Hypothesis

The use of cellular agents has great potential for simulating large populations of virtually living individuals (WHITE, 2007), who possess some form of intelligence, making the modeling of a virtual epidemic technically feasible. By adopting relevant and pertinent mathematical relations (WILLOX, 2003), biological characteristics, and epidemiological bulletins, in conjunction with suitable technologies, it is expected to establish an effective, accurate simulation model capable of generating pandemic reports that are faithful to the numbers of cases and deaths in various simulated scenarios, compared to the real outspread of the disease within a city-level scope.

## Justification

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant impact on public health and the global economy since its onset in 2019 (FU, 2021). By the beginning of 2023, the pandemic had caused an estimated global loss of USD 29.4 trillion (VISCUSI, 2023), in addition to impacts on the physical and mental health of the population, and an increase in waste generation (organic and inorganic), which have direct and indirect impacts on the environment, such as air, water, and soil pollution (ISLAM et al., 2016). Events like these result in significantly negative impacts on society and its environment. In this sense, it is extremely necessary that measures be taken to prevent and contain the next major pandemic.

However, although there is extensive literature on the mathematical modeling of COVID-19, studies and models that investigate the simulation of the spread of epidemiological outbreaks at a local level are scarce, considering various factors such as the population and physical characteristics of a given city, combined with general disease data, such as viral and behavioral characteristics. In this way, the impact of potential pandemics can be contained and mitigated on state, national, and international scales by addressing the spread and development of a pathology at the municipal level. In this regard, this study proposes the use of concepts from theoretical computing and mathematics, as well as algorithms and data structures, composing a simple yet robust pandemic simulation paradigm.

This research is relevant as it can provide important information for public managers' decision-making regarding the fight against emerging diseases. Additionally, it can contribute to the global development of more effective pandemic control strategies, considering viral particularities, but mainly regional specifics.

Finally, conducting this research is also pertinent as it expands knowledge on the application of cellular agents in epidemiology and strengthens collaboration between the institution and other organizations working on pandemic themes.

## Scope

Human behavior modeling is an extremely complex system due to the diversity and variability inherent in actions and decisions. Humans respond to stimuli influenced by a range of factors, including past experiences, social context, emotions, and health states. Human behavior is adaptive, meaning people can learn and change their behavior over time, making modeling this system in its entirety computationally and mathematically challenging.

Thus, we decided to abstract and simplify various factors in this simulation, such as individual behavior, which, instead of being random, will be a constant defined by a fixed number of limited activities. The city's simulation, also a complex system, required abstraction; therefore, we do not deal with a 100% accurate scenario or all the different activities and places that may exist. However, a wide range of activities has been created to generally encompass all the main actions performed in an urban environment in the 21st century.

We chose to use COVID-19 data for project development and validation as it is the most recent example of a pandemic pathology, with a large availability of data facilitating tests and model validation. Campinas was chosen for the city due to its location as our educational institution and its significance as a major industrial and population center in São Paulo. It's important to note that with census records, virtually any city in the world can be used in the simulation, as data entry is generic.

## Objectives

**General objective**

Create an effective pandemic simulation model that can minimize the impact of potential future pandemics by creating different scenarios that act as awareness tools for competent entities and for the population to act preventively in the midst of a potential pandemic.

**Specific objectives**

The specific objectives of this research are:

- To incorporate the technical and theoretical foundation of epidemiology;
- Analyze the theoretical base and literature on the viral characteristics of COVID-19;
- Collect geographic and demographic data from Campinas, transposing it virtually;
- Study and develop algorithms based on the behavior of agents suitable for simulating individuals in a virtualized pandemic environment;
- Elaborate the practical implementation of the theoretical foundations of dissemination in a computational model using systemic methodologies and techniques, incorporating epidemiological data;
- Test and evaluate the effectiveness of the system, based on real data collected from epidemiological bulletins, databases, and reports provided by the government;
- Establish a generic pandemic simulation model, capable of simulating the unfolding of a pandemic in any city with Census data and mainly respiratory pathology.

## Background

Aiming to promote a better approach to pandemic simulation and, consequently, greater accuracy for the simulation, the system to be developed utilizes the union of various algorithms, concepts of theoretical computer science, and mathematical modeling of disease dissemination to achieve this goal. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand, primarily, the studies of virus spread analysis, the characteristics of the virus that will be simulated (COVID-19), the field of cellular automata theory in conjunction with existing epidemiological approaches, and their mathematical basis.

**Multi-Agent Systems**

Multi-agent systems are systems composed of intelligent agents that are situated in an environment and are capable of interacting to solve complex problems (WOOLDRIDGE, 2009). An agent can be seen as a computer system capable of responding to input stimuli (called perceptions), and through a process of reasoning and planning, generate an output in the form of actions in the environment (WOOLDRIDGE, 2009). The multi-agent system paradigm provides the benefits of: (i) enabling the resolution of complex problems in a distributed manner, without a central processing and failure point, where resources and capabilities are distributed across a network of interconnected agents; (ii) allowing the modeling of systems through the design of autonomous intelligent agents, capable of communicating, as the main component; and (iii) within the context of this work, enabling the simulation of behaviors of complex entities, such as human beings.

**Mathematical Modeling in Disease Dissemination**

Although it was in Hippocrates' "Epidemics" that the quest for understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread began, Bernoulli is considered a pioneer in the field of mathematical modeling in epidemiology. In his 1760 work, he demonstrated the effectiveness of the variolation technique, which involved the inoculation of benign smallpox to prevent complications from the disease (BERNOULLI, 1760). However, it was in 1927 that Kermack and McKendrick proposed what can be seen as the starting point for the design of current mathematical models (KERMACK; MCKENDRICK, 1927); the SIR model. Different types of mathematical models can be taken into account, depending on the division of the population to be modeled. The mentioned SIR model segments individuals as (ALMEIDA, 2014):

- Susceptible: Individuals who have not yet developed immunity against the infection, meaning they can become infected if exposed to it.
- Infected: Individuals who have contracted the disease and have the capacity to transmit it to susceptible people.
- Recovered: Individuals who have recovered from the infection and acquired immunity, therefore, do not contribute to the spread of the disease.

Many infections have a time interval in which an individual has been infected but does not yet show symptoms or presents an asymptomatic condition; during this time, the epidemiological process is called incubation (ALENE, 2021), the individual is considered exposed. In this case, the SEIR model presents a new class of individuals, characterized by the letter "E" for exposed, in the acronym. Some infections, such as those caused by the coronaviruses responsible for the common cold, do not confer lasting immunity, lacking a defined recovery phase (EDRIDGE, 2020). Therefore, after an infection, individuals become susceptible again. In this case, the SIS models are configured. From the exposed models, there are other derivations, such as SIRS or SEIRS. According to the characteristics of COVID-19, the SEIR model is found to be the most appropriate to be incorporated into the simulation.

In addition, the SEIR model can be implemented analytically through differential equations presented in equations (1), (2), (3), and (4). In all the presented equations, 𝑡 refers to time in days.

**Conceitos epidemiológicos pertinentes**

Os vírus estão "no precipício da vida e da morte" (ANDREWES, 1967). No microscópio, um vírus parece um cristal geométrico morto. Mas, quando faz de uma célula de um ser vivo seu hospedeiro, pode replicar-se rapidamente.

Um vírus é constituído por, basicamente, duas partes: material genético e cápsula proteica. De forma simplificada, depois de se infiltrar em uma célula, o vírus reescreve o DNA da célula e transforma-a para que produza centenas ou mesmo milhares de cópias de si próprio. Quando estas cópias do vírus deixam a célula afetada, ficam novamente sem vida até entrarem em outra célula e o ciclo é reiniciado. Os danos celulares causados pelo processo de reescrita genética causam a doença. A Figure 2 representa o processo infeccioso de doenças virais.

Figure 4 - A relação entre infecciosidade e sintomas do vírus

Fonte: Rhodes (1996)

Os rótulos acima da linha na Figure 2 descrevem a infecciosidade do hospedeiro, enquanto os rótulos abaixo da linha descrevem a dinâmica da doença. Observe que o período infeccioso pode começar antes ou após o início dos sintomas.

O objetivo de um vírus entrar em uma célula viva é se multiplicar; no entanto, quando o hospedeiro desenvolve anticorpos para combater a infecção, o vírus precisa encontrar outro hospedeiro. Como resultado de ser infectado, uma pessoa geralmente se torna infecciosa, isto é, capaz de infectar outras pessoas e manifestar sintomas de forma a ficar doente. Um hospedeiro infectado apresenta sintomas, que geralmente são métodos para ajudar o vírus a se propagar para novos hospedeiros, como tosse, por exemplo. Entretanto, a doença não pode ser muito debilitante porque o contágio cessa se o hospedeiro morrer. A Figure 2 mostra a ligação entre cada uma das fases da infecção, com cada fase detalhada abaixo.

Período latente: Este é o intervalo de tempo durante uma infecção no qual o vírus ainda não desenvolveu o potencial de transmissão para um novo hospedeiro.

Período infeccioso: Durante esta fase, o vírus é contagioso e pode ser transmitido a outras pessoas usando mecanismos orgânicos de propagação.

Recuperados ou removidos: Se tratando de vírus, um hospedeiro que desenvolveu imunidade natural ou morreu não é mais capaz de contribuir para o processo de reprodução. O vírus, portanto, não pode se reproduzir em ambos os cenários.

Período de incubação: No início de uma infecção, pode não haver indícios de infecção; esse é conhecido como o período de incubação. Os vírus se reproduzem mais durante a junção desta fase e o período infeccioso (RHODES, 1996). Isso se deve ao fato de que os hospedeiros desconhecem o fato de estarem infectados, mantendo interação normal com outros potenciais hospedeiros, até então saudáveis.

Sintomas: Este é o estágio da infecção quando há indicadores aparentes de infecção. O tratamento para infecções virais geralmente consiste no alívio dos sintomas e na separação de pessoas não contaminadas.

**Achatamento da curva**

No contexto de surtos de doenças infecciosas, como pandemias, "achatar a curva" surgiu como uma técnica crítica para controlar e gerenciar a propagação de doenças. O objetivo de achatar a curva é diminuir a taxa de infecção, minimizar a pressão sobre os sistemas de saúde e, eventualmente, salvar vidas.

A expressão "achatar a curva" refere-se a uma curva epidemiológica, frequentemente representada graficamente e que mostra o número de novos casos de uma doença infecciosa ao longo do tempo. Em um surto descontrolado, a curva apresenta uma elevação rápida e acentuada, indicando um aumento significativo no número de infecções em um curto período de tempo. Esta curva acentuada implica uma carga significativa nos sistemas de saúde, podendo sobrecarregar os hospitais e levando a um aumento da frequência de casos graves e de óbitos.

O achatamento da curva visa enfrentar os desafios colocados pela curva epidêmica acentuada. Os principais objetivos desta estratégia incluem:

- Retardar a propagação: A curva pode ser achatada aplicando medidas para diminuir a taxa de transmissão, como distanciamento social, uso de máscaras e práticas de higiene. Retardar a propagação da doença permite que os sistemas de saúde gerenciem melhor o fluxo de casos, garantindo que aqueles que precisam de atenção médica recebam atendimento adequado.
- Evitar a sobrecarga do sistema de saúde: Ao diminuir o número de novos casos por dia, a demanda por recursos de saúde, como leitos hospitalares, ventiladores e equipe médica, pode ser adiada por um período de tempo mais longo. Isso evita que os sistemas de saúde fiquem sobrecarregados, permitindo que eles ofereçam um melhor atendimento ao paciente e melhorem os resultados gerais.

**Prevalência e incidência**

Na epidemiologia, a prevalência é definida como a proporção da população com uma condição em um momento específico (prevalência pontual) ou durante um período de tempo (prevalência de período) (KIER, 2011). A prevalência aumenta quando novos casos de doenças são identificados (incidência) e diminui quando um paciente é curado ou morre. Muitas vezes, a prevalência de período fornecerá um quadro mais preciso da prevalência geral, pois a prevalência de período inclui todos os indivíduos com a doença entre duas datas: casos antigos e novos (incidentes), bem como aqueles que foram curados ou morreram durante o período (WHITING, 2015).

**Análise do comportamento do vírus em diferentes ambientes**

Há diversos fatores que influenciam na disseminação do vírus em determinado ambiente, como por exemplo fatores sociais, econômicos, higiênicos e atmosféricos, além das próprias características do vírus. Para abordar o comportamento do COVID-19 primeiro precisamos obter o conhecimento de seu modelo de transmissão.

O COVID é transmitido principalmente por pequenas gotículas produzidas quando uma pessoa infectada fala, tosse ou espirra, muitas das quais podem permanecer suspensas no ar por minutos a horas. Tocar em superfícies ou objetos contaminados é possivelmente uma forma de propagação do COVID, porém o Centro de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças (_Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC_), agência do Departamento de Saúde e Serviços Humanos dos Estados Unidos da América, acredita que a principal forma de propagação é de pessoa para pessoa por meio de gotículas respiratórias. Portanto, nesta pesquisa, focamos principalmente no risco de gotículas expelidas no ar.

**Interação de referência**

Começamos estimando o risco de interagir com uma única pessoa positiva para COVID-19 em ambientes fechados por 1 hora a uma distância de socialização normal de 1 metro durante uma conversa em volume normal.

_Risco da atividade: Falar com 1 pessoa com COVID-19, por 1 hora, dentro de casa, sem máscara, a 1 metro = 14%_

Para esta estimativa, foram combinados estudos de passageiros em trens (HU et al., 2021), modelos de transmissão de aerossol (JIMENEZ, 2022), que usam dados de rastreamento de contato, meta-análises (CHU et al., 2020) e estudos prospectivos (CHENG et al., 2020). Pode-se, a partir desta estimativa, multiplicar os 14% em 1,5x com base no aumento do contágio da variante B117 (DAVIES et al., 2013) e, novamente, em 1,5x, como consequência da variante Delta (DAVIES et al., 2013).

Assim é definido uma “interação de referência”, que será usada como ponto de partida para estimar o risco de outros tipos de interações.

**Modificadores**

Há diversos modificadores para o risco da atividade, como o uso de máscara, ar livre, ventilação, distanciamento, entre outros. Esses fatores influenciam a probabilidade de disseminação do vírus e devem ser analisados.

Para estimar o risco de atividade de diferentes interações, modificamos nossa estimativa com base em como a interação em questão é diferente da interação de referência acima, com base nos seguintes fatores:

- Duração da interação
- Máscaras
- Localização (exterior ou interior)
- Distância entre si
- Volume da conversa

As estimativas para esses modificadores são:

Quadro 1 - Modificadores no risco de contrair COVID-19

| Modificador                                          | Mudança no risco de contrair COVID-19 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Eu estou usando uma máscara cirúrgica                | / 2                                   |
| Outra pessoa está usando uma máscara cirúrgica       | / 4                                   |
| Ambiente externo                                     | / 20 ou mais                          |
| 2 metros de distância                                | / 2                                   |
| A cada 1 metro adicional de distância (até 4 metros) | / 2                                   |
| Falar alto (gritar, falar sobre música, cantar)      | x 5                                   |
| Não falar (como andar de trem)                       | / 5                                   |

**Cálculos de exemplo**

Para calcular o risco de atividade de almoçar no parque com um amigo, começa-se com 14% (o risco de atividade da interação de referência) e os modificadores são aplicados conforme necessário:

14% \* 2 (ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑠) / 20 ( ) / 2 ( â 2 − 3 ) = 0, 7%

Como resultado, há 0,7% de chance de se contrair COVID-19 com essa única atividade se a outra pessoa estiver contaminada. Vale notar que não há modificador para máscaras ou volume porque a interação de referência já está contabilizada sem máscara e no volume normal. Para uma ocasião de jantar entre duas pessoas, considerando os seguintes fatores: 2 horas, dentro de casa, a uma distância de cerca de 1 metro, sem máscaras. Com a aplicação dos modificadores, 14% \* 2 (ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑠) = 28%. Como resultado, há 28% de chance de se contrair COVID-19 caso a outra pessoa esteja contaminada.

**Máscaras**

A maioria das fontes é extraída de _An Evidence Review of Face Masks against COVID-19_ (HOWARD et al., 2021), que examina uma variedade de tipos de estudo, alguns específicos do COVID-19 e outros que estudam o filtro de partículas como uma propriedade do tecido ou para outros patógenos, como a gripe.

A estimativa se inicia com uma redução numérica na contaminação para cada aspecto de máscaras cirúrgicas. A tabela abaixo mostra os vários resultados desses estudos:

Quadro 2 - Características de máscaras cirúrgicas e a respectiva redução na contaminação de um patógeno

| Medida                                                | Resultado                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Proporção de aerossol de tosse bloqueado              | 60% (redução de 1.7x)       |
| Fator de proteção                                     | 2\.5x                       |
| Redução de cópias virais                              | 3\.4x                       |
| Redução de aerossóis "finos"                          | 2\.8x                       |
| Redução de aerossóis "grossos"                        | 25x                         |
| Redução de unidades formadoras de colônias            | 7x                          |
| Proporção do fluxo de ar que vaza ao redor da máscara | 12% (Proteção máxima de 8x) |
| Redução na contagem de gotículas de tosse             | 10x                         |

Conclui-se que as máscaras cirúrgicas são substancialmente melhores para bloquear partículas grandes (25x) do que partículas pequenas (2,8x) (MILTON et al., 2013). A tosse parece ser filtrada de forma extremamente eficiente (DAVIES et al., 2013) e (FISCHER et al., 2020), o que implica que são principalmente partículas grandes. Como resultado, é definido um número um pouco maior do que o valor total citado em _Influenza Virus Aerosols in Human Exhaled Breath: Particle Size, Culturability, and Effect of Surgical Masks_ (MILTON et al., 2013), (3,4x), que é 1/4.

Obtém-se as estimativas para máscaras de algodão finas e grossas que oferecem menos proteção a outras, comparando-as com máscaras cirúrgicas e entre si. Um "lenço" é aproximadamente 56-65% tão protetor quanto uma máscara cirúrgica, enquanto uma "mistura de algodão" é aproximadamente 70-78% tão protetora (DAVIES et al., 2013)

A máscara caseira é aproximadamente 92% tão eficaz quanto a máscara cirúrgica no bloqueio de unidades formadoras de colônias (DAVIES et al., 2013). No geral, uma máscara de algodão grossa e bem ajustada é cerca de 80% a 90% tão eficaz quanto uma máscara cirúrgica (que de acordo com as estimativas reduz a exposição em 4x), resultando em 2,5x-3x proteção, que arredondamos para 3x (multiplicador de 1/3) para máscaras de algodão grosso. Como resultado, uma máscara caseira mais fina ou de pior ajuste parece ser pelo menos 50% tão eficaz quanto uma máscara cirúrgica, que arredondamos para 2x (1/2 multiplicador).

**Vacinação**

Em uma população não vacinada, 17% dos casos nunca apresentam sintomas e esses indivíduos têm 42% mais chances de transmitir COVID do que indivíduos que eventualmente apresentam sintomas (BYAMBASUREN et al., 2020).

A partir disso, calcula-se que, para cada infecção, há 0,83 infecções sintomáticas e 0,17 infecções assintomáticas ou, para cada infecção sintomática, há 0,17 / 0,83 ≈ 0,2 infecções assintomáticas. Serão estudadas apenas as marcas de vacinas aplicadas no Brasil, sendo elas a Astrazeneca, Pfizer, CoronaVac e Johnson & Johnson, e suas taxas de infecciosidade e eficácia.

**Astrazeneca**

O estudo de teste da AstraZeneca feito pela Universidade de Oxford em 2021 relatou que, entre os participantes totalmente vacinados, houve 57 casos assintomáticos e 84 casos sintomáticos, ou 0,68 casos assintomáticos por caso sintomático.

Houve uma redução de 59,8% nos casos de COVID sintomático entre pessoas totalmente vacinadas com a vacina da AstraZeneca (BERNAL et al., 2021).

Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas não vacinadas, isso nos dá:

Quadro 3 - Análise da eficácia da vacina Astrazeneca

|                      | Grupo de Controle | Grupo Vacinado   |
| :------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Casos sintomáticos   | 1                 | 0,4              |
| Casos assintomáticos | 0,2               | 0,4\*0,68 = 0,27 |

Fonte: Adaptado de Byambasuren et al. (2020)

Tratando casos assintomáticos como 0,4 de infecciosidade relativa, isso dá uma taxa ajustada de infecciosidade de:

(0, 4 + 0, 4 \* 0, 27) / (1 + 0 , 4 \* 0, 2) = 0, 47

**Pfizer**

Pfizer mostrou 95% de redução em casos sintomáticos de COVID (POLACK et al., 2020). O CDC mostrou que houve uma redução de 90% em todos os casos (sintomáticos + assintomáticos) 14 ou mais dias depois dos participantes receberem a vacina da Pfizer (THOMPSON et al., 2021).

Em seguida, calcula-se novamente o número de casos assintomáticos entre os indivíduos vacinados com base nestas pesquisas:

1. Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas não vacinadas, há 0,2 casos assintomáticos, ou 1,2 casos no total (BYAMBASUREN et al., 2020)
1. Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas não vacinadas, há 0,05 casos sintomáticos entre vacinados.
1. Para cada caso total entre pessoas não vacinadas, há 0,1 caso total entre pessoas vacinadas (CDC).
1. Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas não vacinadas, há 1,2 \* 0,1 = 0,12 casos no total.
1. Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas não vacinadas, há 0,12 - 0,05 = 0,07 casos assintomáticos entre pessoas vacinadas.
1. Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas vacinadas, existem 0,07 / 0,05 = 1,4 casos sintomáticos entre pessoas vacinadas.

Em seguida, combinamos isso com o estudo de Bernal et al., que constatou que a vacina da Pfizer é 87,9% (intervalo de confiança de 95%: 78,2 a 93,2) eficaz na redução da chance de infecção sintomática pela variante Delta.

Tratando casos nunca sintomáticos como 0,4 de infecciosidade relativa, isso dá uma taxa ajustada de infecciosidade de:

(0, 12 + 0, 4 \* 0, 17) / (1 + 0, 4 \* 0, 2) = 0, 17

**CoronaVac**

Entre os participantes vacinados, 51 testaram positivo para SARS-CoV-2 durante o acompanhamento (41 antes e 10 após a segunda dose); 29 foram diagnosticados por triagem assintomática, nos dando 0,56 casos assintomáticos por caso sintomático (TANG et al., 2021).

Não houve casos positivos sintomáticos ou de exposição conhecida mais de 7 dias após a segunda dose. Os participantes não vacinados apresentaram maior incidência cumulativa de resultado positivo nos testes em comparação aos participantes vacinados e maior incidência de resultados positivos nos testes por triagem assintomática, para sintomas ou para exposição conhecida.

Para cada caso sintomático entre pessoas não vacinadas, isso nos dá:

**Johnson & Johnson**

A Johnson & Johnson realizou testes sorológicos para anticorpos não relacionados à proteína spike nos dias 1, 29 e 71 para rastrear infecções assintomáticas. Eles também consideraram uma infecção assintomática caso um participante apresentasse um teste de PCR positivo, mas sem sintomas. Os casos sintomáticos foram contabilizados quando um paciente apresentava sintomas e testou positivo no PCR pelo menos 14 dias após a administração da vacina.

**Taxa de Hospitalização e Morte por grupo de idade**

Em ordem de representar com maior acurácia a probabilidade de contaminação do COVID-19 na população, deve ser levado em consideração a susceptibilidade de cada indivíduo na contração da doença. Fatores como doenças crônicas/condições de saúde anteriores (diabetes, doenças cardíacas, doenças pulmonares, etc.), idade e gênero influenciam tanto na probabilidade de contração da doença como na taxa de hospitalização e morte (ASLANER, 2021).

## Metodologia

**Critérios do Produto**

- Características da população, cidade e atividades que compõem as rotinas dos indivíduos podem ser alteradas, excluídas ou adicionadas;
- Cada indivíduo tem suas próprias características que os diferenciam dos demais, como idade, sexo, casa, escola e/ou trabalho, que são definidas a partir do senso da cidade a ser simulada;
- Algoritmo que distribua estas características únicas a todos os indivíduos na simulação;
- Algoritmo de disseminação do vírus que consiga, a partir do estado dos indivíduos, seu ambiente e características da doença determinar uma probabilidade de infecção;
- Todos os indivíduos possuem sua própria rotina com uma série de atividades pré definidas com base em suas características;
- É possível alterar variáveis de combate à doença, resultando assim em diferentes cenários pandêmicos.

**Materiais e softwares utilizados**

Para a análise exploratória dos dados e criação dos gráficos foram utilizadas bibliotecas da linguagem de programação Python em conjunto com Jupyter Notebook, devido ao seu fácil uso e uma gama de funcionalidades bastante acessíveis.

Para a simulação, foi utilizada a linguagem de programação TypeScript, que possui um ecossistema bastante popular, cuja comunidade e bibliotecas servem como facilitadoras do processo de desenvolvimento. Além disso, por ser derivada de JavaScript, a simulação pode ser convertida de forma a poder ser feita em qualquer website sem maiores complicações.

  - Armazenamento em disco de SSD M.2 NVMe 512 GB.

**Etapas**

**Estudo da eficácia de performance entre diferentes linguagens de programação**

Para alcançar a melhor performance durante a simulação, realizamos diferentes testes com diferentes linguagens de programação de alto nível para entender qual possui o melhor desempenho nas tarefas que terá que realizar. Quanto menor for o tempo de execução e uso de memória, mais viável será a eficiência, replicação e execução do programa.

As linguagens testadas foram as seguintes:

- TypeScript;
- C++/C;
- Fortran;
- Go;
- Julia;
- Java;
- Scala;
- Rust;
- Python.

Elas foram escolhidas com base em sua facilidade no desenvolvimento, disponibilidade de bibliotecas, comunidade e performance (CASS, 2022). Para validar seu desempenho e definir a linguagem que será utilizada no desenvolvimento do modelo, propomos um caso teste que simula um cenário real no projeto: cada programa possui uma classe que representa um indivíduo, este indivíduo possui todas as propriedades que serão utilizadas durante o cálculo de disseminação do vírus de forma a emular o uso de memória. Para a disseminação, necessita-se que tenhamos acesso aos indivíduos na mesma localização, logo, é dado um vetor de todos os indivíduos instanciados com valores distintos ao algoritmo, que deve retornar os indivíduos em volta do atual. Vale ressaltar que todas as linguagens compiladas foram executadas por meio de linha de comando, sem a utilização de _softwares_ terceiros.

Em cada linguagem foram desenvolvidos dois programas, um otimizado e outro não. Um programa otimizado significa que foram implementados algoritmos e estruturas de dados complexos como paralelismo, concorrência, _multithreading_ e semáforos, e algumas funcionalidades próprias da linguagem que podem ou não aumentar sua eficiência.

Foram realizados testes iterativos para um conjunto de indivíduos com o tamanho da população de Campinas, cerca de 1 milhão e 100 mil habitantes, do programa em cada linguagem, com indivíduos e localizações aleatórias, a partir dos quais foram gerados os seguintes gráficos utilizando a biblioteca Matplotlib de Python em um Jupyter Notebook:

A partir da análise dos dados, foi decidido que a linguagem de programação que será utilizada no desenvolvimento do modelo será o TypeScript, que, sem otimização, apresentou ótimos resultados em ambos os testes, além de apresentar uma ampla gama de bibliotecas, ecossistema com comunidade bastante ativa e sintaxe produtiva. No futuro, pode-se, também, ser feito uma transpilação do código desenvolvido em TypeScript para JavaScript devido ao fato do primeiro ser um superconjunto do segundo, possibilitando, assim, uma exportação do modelo para uma versão web através de um site e/ou API REST, favorecendo a acessibilidade à pesquisa e ao modelo de simulação.

**Representação da cidade virtualmente**

Representar uma cidade de forma virtual, com acurácia e fidedignidade, é um desafio a ser considerado. Por isso, optamos por abstrair a dinâmica geral de uma cidade embasando-nos, para tanto, nos conceitos geográficos de fixos e fluxos. Os fixos referem-se aos elementos estáticos da cidade, como edifícios, estradas e outras infraestruturas. Estes são os componentes permanentes que formam o esqueleto físico da cidade. Por outro lado, os fluxos representam os elementos dinâmicos, como o movimento de pessoas, veículos e informações. Estes fluxos são cruciais para determinar o funcionamento de uma cidade no dia a dia (BARROS, 2020).

Em nossa abordagem de modelagem, buscamos uma representação simplificada que captura a essência desses dois aspectos. Embora nos concentremos na infraestrutura básica e nos movimentos principais dentro da própria cidade, optamos por simplificar ou omitir certos aspectos mais complexos, como a locomoção de indivíduos entre cidades vizinhas. Essa simplificação ajuda a manter o modelo gerenciável e focado nos aspectos mais críticos da dinâmica urbana.

Na abstração da representação da cidade, uma das abordagens é criar uma matriz de a x b células, com cada célula equivalente a 1m² da cidade real sendo utilizada como localização geográfica do indivíduo. Decidimos por não utilizar desta abordagem pois ocorreria um desperdício de memória em um estado onde certa célula não está ocupada por nenhum indivíduo. Ao invés disso, cada indivíduo tem em seus atributos a abstração da localização, eles não possuem coordenadas definidas, mas sim um estado dizendo seu lugar. Por exemplo, imaginemos que em uma cidade há 30 mil pontos de trabalho, quando o indivíduo estiver trabalhando, ele não terá a coordenada exata de seu trabalho, e sim sua identificação, que é diferente dos outros 30 mil. Assim, quando formos realizar o cálculo de disseminação do vírus nesse ambiente, procuramos dentre o banco de indivíduos, todos que naquele momento possuem como identificação do ponto de trabalho o mesmo do indivíduo atual.

Para simular a cidade é necessário os censos sociais e universais do local para assim conseguir certas informações cruciais para o modelo. Essas informações são:

- t

Por questões de indisponibilidade de dados recentes, foi utilizado o censo de 2010 do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Alertamos para o fato de que, devido aos dados se referirem a uma cidade dez anos no passado em relação a que encarou a pandemia do COVID-19, os resultados de mortes e casos podem sofrer incoerências mínimas.

As informações solicitadas possuem importância na definição das características dos indivíduos, suas rotinas, taxa de disseminação do vírus. Pelo fato de que os dados obtidos pelo censo do IBGE de 2010 apresentaram pequenas incongruências entre si, foi necessário o desenvolvimento de um algoritmo de normalização dos dados.

**Normalização**

Devido a diversas incongruências encontradas nos dados do censo, bem como entre diferentes fontes de dados utilizadas, como o Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego (MTE), Relatórios de Informações Sociais do Município de Campinas e Boletins Epidemiológicos da Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Campinas, foi necessária a implementação de um algoritmo, utilizando de relações matemáticas, para a normalização dos diversos dados.

Dado um conjunto de valores totais para uma única categoria de um parâmetro a ser atribuído para uma população de indivíduos, a normalização dos conjunto de parâmetros será dada pela seguinte relação matemática:

**REVER**

- ∑ ( )

=1

1. % = ÷

   2. = −

1. = + % ×

Para cada parâmetro , sua porcentagem de “contribuição”, % _,_ é calculada através da divisão da quantidade total de valores do parâmetro pela soma dos valores de todos os parâmetros de um conjunto _,_ denominada (1)_._ Com a porcentagem de “contribuição” de um parâmetro não normalizado, é atribuído ao seu correspondente normalizado o montante anterior, _,_ somado

com o respectivo montante faltante, calculado pela porcentagem de “contribuição” de _,_ % _,_ multiplicada pelo número de indivíduos a serem normalizados, (3)_. ,_

por sua vez, o número de indivíduos a serem normalizados, fora calculado através da diferença entre os indivíduos totais pela soma dos valores de todos os parâmetros de um conjunto _, ,_ (2)_._

Após uma bateria de testes, comprovamos que a relação matemática acima descrita mantém a proporção original entre os diferentes parâmetros, sendo capaz de normalizar quaisquer parâmetros formatados, escalonando-os para cima ou para baixo.

Dessa forma, fomos capazes de combinar conjuntos de dados de fontes diferentes com valores distintos mantendo a razão original dos mesmos, de forma a utilizarmos dados fidedignos e escalonados para nosso modelo.

**Representação dos indivíduos na cidade**

São atribuídas a cada indivíduo dentro da cidade certas atividades de forma aleatória com base em suas características definidas de acordo com os dados sociodemográficos. Estas atividades envolvem locomoção e encontro com outros indivíduos, que podem categorizar cenários de lazer, trabalho, ou estudo, e representam a rotina deste indivíduo na cidade.

Além das rotinas e suas próprias características, foi necessário distribuir a população em suas respectivas residências a fim de obter-se uma rotina de trabalho-casa ou escola-casa.

As residências foram distribuídas com base nos dados do IBGE, bem como a quantidade de indivíduos por residência. A idade destes indivíduos também foi levada em consideração nesta distribuição, uma vez que existem parâmetros relacionados. Por exemplo, é improvável um cenário no qual um indivíduo de zero a quatro anos mora em uma residência sozinho.

Portanto, a população virtual modelada apresenta características detalhadas análogas à vida real. Dessa forma, cada indivíduo possui os seguintes atributos devidamente distribuídos de acordo com os dados disponíveis, de forma coerente e pertinente:

- Identificação;
- Sexo;
- Faixa etária;
- Status educacional;
- Residência:
  - Identificação;
  - Região;
  - Número de residentes;
  - Residentes (demais indivíduos).
- Renda;
- Meio de transporte (público ou privado);
- Tipos de ocupação (trabalho e/ou estudo);
- Ocupações:
  - Identificação;
  - Tipo (trabalho e estudo);
  - Número de indivíduos.
- Vacina:
  - Tipo;
  - Doses.
- Máscara;
- Está hospitalizado?;
- Está morto?;
- Está com COVID?;
- Já teve COVID?;
- Rotina - conjunto de atividades compostas por:
- Identificação;
- Categoria (lazer, afazeres, trabalho, transporte, estudo, etc);
- Duração;
- Distância entre indivíduos;
- Volume da voz dos indivíduos;
- Ambiente (fechado ou aberto).

**Sincronização das atividades na simulação**

Para realizar a simulação de forma que as atividades sejam executadas no tempo certo, e que atividades futuras sejam apenas executadas quando as atuais terminarem, preservando a lógica do indivíduo não poder estar em diferentes lugares ao mesmo tempo, surge a necessidade da implementação de um algoritmo de sincronização destas atividades. Portanto, foram pesquisadas diferentes técnicas computacionais e teóricas para abordar o problema.

**NP-Hard e Algoritmo de Johnson**

Um problema é atribuído à classe NP (tempo polinomial não determinístico) se for solucionável em tempo polinomial por uma máquina de Turing não determinística (BORWEIN, 1987). Problemas NP-hard podem ser de qualquer tipo: problemas de decisão, problemas de pesquisa ou problemas de otimização.

O _Job-Shop Scheduling Problem_ (JSSP) é um problema de otimização combinatória, NP-hard. O objetivo do problema é encontrar a programação ideal para alocar recursos compartilhados ao longo do tempo para atividades concorrentes a fim de reduzir o tempo total necessário para concluir todas as atividades.

Em um JSSP, há um número de trabalhos ( 1, 2, ..., ), que precisarão ser concluídos usando um número de recursos compartilhados, mais comumente denotados como máquinas ( 1, 2, ..., ). Cada trabalho terá operações ( ) que precisarão ser concluídas em uma ordem específica para que o trabalho seja concluído. As operações devem ser concluídas em máquinas específicas e exigem um tempo de processamento ( ) nessa máquina (YAMADA, 1997).

O algoritmo heurístico de S. M. Johnson, ou simplesmente Algoritmo de Johnson é uma das soluções para o JSSP e se comporta da seguinte maneira:

O trabalho tem duas operações, de duração 1 e 2, a serem realizadas nas máquinas 1 e 2 nessa sequência.

1. Lista = \{ 1, 2, ..., }, Lista 1 = {}, Lista 2 = {}.
2. De todas as durações de operação disponíveis, escolha a mínima.

   Se o mínimo pertencer a 1,

   Remova da lista . Adicione ao final da lista 1. Se o mínimo pertencer a 2,

   Remova da lista . Adicione ao início da lista 2.

3. Repita a etapa 2 até que a Lista A esteja vazia.
4. Junte a Lista L1 e a Lista L2. Essa é a sequência ideal.

Nos inspiramos neste algoritmo para propor a lógica de abordagem da sincronização. Todas as atividades que estão acontecendo em determinado momento ficarão em um vetor (arranjo) ordenado de forma crescente de acordo com o tempo das atividades, ou seja, os primeiros índices do vetor conterão as atividades que estão acontecendo agora e que possuem o menor tempo dentre todas as outras.

Toda vez que uma nova atividade se inicia, é adicionada ao vetor e será acionado o algoritmo de disseminação para ela de acordo com suas características e de seus indivíduos, mudando seus estados de acordo com o resultado da disseminação.

O algoritmo de disseminação é acionado apenas uma vez para cada atividade. A cada momento, as atividades do início do vetor são computadas, seu tempo é adicionado ao tempo global da simulação e ela é removida do vetor, esse tempo é removido de todas as outras atividades acontecendo no momento. Após isso, é feita uma busca por todos os indivíduos para ver se a atividade em que estavam já acabou e se começam uma nova naquele tempo da simulação, e assim o vetor é ordenado novamente. Optamos por esta estratégia pois o tempo de execução do programa depende inteiramente da velocidade dos algoritmos de disseminação, ordenação e procura, e não há a necessidade de um gargalo proposital para alterar o tempo da simulação de acordo com um tempo real.

**Análise da eficácia de diferentes algoritmos de ordenação**

Para escolher qual algoritmo de ordenação será utilizado no vetor de atividades, realizamos diversos testes com diferentes algoritmos. A seguir está o gráfico mostrando a relação de tempo de execução, em segundos, por interação, mostrando a performance de cada algoritmo na ordenação de um milhão de atividades de duração aleatória, que simboliza o pior cenário possível onde cada indivíduo está em uma atividade diferente.

Figure 8 - Gráfico de análise dos algoritmos de ordenação

A partir das análises dos dados, foi escolhido o algoritmo de _Quick Sort_ para ser utilizado no processo de ordenação das atividades, o que condiz com o fato de ser um dos mais eficientes e rápidos dentre todos os outros (XIANG, 2011), e ter complexidade temporal e espacial de ( ) nos melhores casos, proporcionando ótima performance.

**Utilização da fundamentação teórica para cálculo da probabilidade de disseminação da doença**

A disseminação é uma abstração do conceito de autômatos celulares na Vizinhança de Moore: o estado de saúde de cada indivíduo é alterado com base nos dados dos indivíduos virtualmente próximos a ele, dada uma regra fixa. Essa regra fixa é o fluxo de cálculo da probabilidade de disseminação da doença.

Esse fluxo é realizado, portanto, como uma linha de produção. De forma iterativa, o algoritmo extrai todas as informações começando a partir de cada característica e estado de saúde dos indivíduos, bem como características da atividade, ambiente virtual, parâmetros globais acerca do vírus, seu comportamento e probabilidades dos modificadores anteriormente definidos, como o tipo de máscara e vacina. Desse modo, é determinada a probabilidade de disseminação da doença utilizando as taxas de risco da atividade, risco individual de cada indivíduo e prevalência de casos na região. Todos os valores dos modificadores e exemplos de cálculos são mostrados durante a fundamentação teórica. Se esta probabilidade for maior que um limiar mínimo ainda a ser estipulado, é considerado que o indivíduo contraiu a doença.

**Validação do modelo de disseminação utilizando o COVID-19**

Para simular diferentes cenários com diferentes configurações de uso de máscaras, distanciamento social e tráfego de pessoas, precisamos primeiro ter um modelo capaz de gerar o mesmo números de mortes e casos nas condições exatas do cenário real da pandemia. Desenvolvemos a seguinte metodologia para a validação do modelo:

Antes de testarmos o modelo para a simulação de cenários dado características de doenças potencialmente epidêmicas recentes, precisamos primeiro validar utilizando dados de uma pandemia que já aconteceu, como a do COVID-19, pois senão não saberemos se os cenários simulados são verdadeiros ou não.

Para a validação, utilizamos o método de _Hold-out Validation_, que consiste em dividir os conjuntos de dados de boletins epidemiológicos dos anos 2020 a 2021 entre treinamento e teste, utilizando uma proporção de 80/20. Os 20% dos dados representam os primeiros meses da pandemia em 2020 e é utilizado para treinar o modelo, o qual com base nesses dados define variáveis de prevalência do vírus, taxa de aumento de casos, entre outros.

Após a incorporação dos dados iniciais o modelo se torna autossuficiente, mudando suas taxas e variáveis com base nos casos que ele mesmo gera. Ao final da simulação do período desejado, utilizamos os 80% dos dados restantes para validar a acurácia das predições.

## Resultados

No estágio atual de desenvolvimento da pesquisa, foi demonstrada na teoria e confirmada na prática a viabilidade computacional de modelagem de uma população virtual com atributos, características e rotinas análogas às de indivíduos em uma população real, com embasamento em dados geográficos e demográficos. No entanto, a implementação desse modelo provou ser desafiadora, exigindo a consideração de uma ampla gama de parâmetros para criar uma população virtual que seja minimamente relacionada à real.

Além disso, nossa pesquisa comprovou, até o presente momento, que é computacionalmente viável simular uma pandemia por meio de autômatos celulares que representam os indivíduos em uma cidade abstrata virtualizada. Essa abordagem tem o potencial de fornecer percepções valiosas sobre como as doenças infecciosas se disseminam e o quão eficaz cada tipo de intervenção é.

Como resultado parcial desta pesquisa, foram simulados, seguindo o embasamento bibliográfico, teórico e metodológico estabelecido, 3 anos da pandemia de COVID-19 em Campinas: de 2020 a 2023. Os gráficos abaixo representam, de forma ilustrativa, os resultados obtidos a partir da modelagem com a respectiva acurácia quando comparados com os dados reais.

O cenário simulado reflete o uso de máscaras e a vacinação da população análogo ao que ocorreu de fato durante a pandemia. Os dados simulados, no entanto, mostram um número inflacionado de casos e mortes em comparação com os dados reais observados em Campinas durante o mesmo período. Especificamente, a simulação resultou em aproximadamente 720 mil casos e 20 mil mortes, enquanto em Campinas foram registrados cerca de 200 mil casos e 5 mil mortes.

Essa discrepância sugere a necessidade de mais testes e refinamento do modelo para aumentar sua acurácia. É importante melhorar o modelo não só em termos técnicos, mas também explorando e utilizando melhor os atributos de cada indivíduo. Após implementarmos tais modificações e melhorias, esperamos reduzir o número total de casos previstos pela simulação, evitando a hiper contaminação virtual que não ocorreu na realidade.

Embora o modelo atual precise de aprimoramentos, ele já demonstra potencial para prever o comportamento de novas doenças e cenários epidêmicos futuros. A ênfase deve ser colocada no aprimoramento e polimento do modelo para garantir que ele possa simular com mais precisão os impactos de intervenções de saúde pública, como vacinação e uso de máscaras, em diferentes cenários epidêmicos. Espera-se, como resultado final, que o modelo atinja uma acurácia de 50% a 60%, superando os atuais modelos, que atuam na faixa de 30% a 40%.

## Conclusões

A partir do objetivo inicial de criar um modelo capaz de simular doenças potencialmente pandêmicas em qualquer cenário virtual, foi proposta a utilização conjunta de diversas fontes de dados, embasamento matemático, conceitos computacionais teóricos e métodos a fim de se obter como produto um modelo de simulação acurado e confiável. Durante o trabalho, foi estudado a fundo cada aspecto da simulação, sua viabilidade, relação com conceitos interdisciplinares e a melhor maneira para ser implementado.

A idealização de tais métodos e sua validação teórica foi concluída, sendo possível estabelecer um modelo teoricamente capaz de simular uma pandemia em escala local, para, dessa forma, mitigar e reduzir os impactos de uma pandemia.

Atestamos para o fato de que embora o projeto esteja lidando com as características do vírus COVID-19 em Campinas, as bases teóricas e metodológicas podem e devem ser implementadas e adaptadas a outras doenças, principalmente respiratórias, e em qualquer cidade que disponha de algum tipo de censo geográfico e demográfico.

Também vale ressaltar que propomos e implementamos com sucesso um simulador pandêmico que se apropria de uma população com atributos detalhados a nível municipal, diferindo de implementações mais gerais, a nível nacional ou estadual, como em _Outbreak diversity in epidemic waves propagating through distinct geographical scales_ (COSTA; COTA; FERREIRA, 2020), e até mesmo adaptações municipais, como a implementação proposta em _Modeling the Spatiotemporal Epidemic Spreading of COVID-19 and the Impact of Mobility and Social Distancing Interventions_ (ARENAS et al., 2020), devido ao ineditismo de uma modelagem que direcionada exclusivamente à escala local. Dessa forma, a coleta e utilização de dados regionais em detrimento de abstrações macroscópicas resultaram em um modelo mais acurado e fidedigno, com baixos requisitos de poder computacional.

Portanto, a utilização de um _cluster,_ ou aglomerado, de diversos simuladores, cada um adequado para uma única cidade de acordo com os dados do censo, possibilita a simulação de escalas estaduais e nacionais constituídas, internamente, por estruturas mais específicas e direcionadas aos municípios, o que corrobora, por conseguinte, para simulações mais acuradas de forma geral.

Assim, obtivemos, como produto da pesquisa que ainda está em andamento, um simulador pandêmico que não se restringe apenas ao caráter matemático da clássica modelagem epidemiológica, como visto em _Spreading phenomena on complex networks and social systems_ (COTA, 2020), incluindo uma vasta gama de parâmetros biológicos, geográficos e demográficos de forma pioneira. Constitui-se, portanto, um modelo que é capaz de simular e predizer o comportamento futuro de potenciais pandemias, principalmente de doenças respiratórias, que pode ser licenciado ou vendido como um _Software as a Service_ (SaaS) para secretarias municipais ou estaduais de saúde, assim como ministérios e organizações competentes, como o Ministério da Saúde e a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS), possibilitando ações preventivas a fim de reduzir os impactos humanos, sociais e econômicos de um surto. Além disso, institutos e empresas públicas e/ou privadas do setor farmacêutico também podem se beneficiar de testes em cenários pandêmicos virtualizados da eficácia de suas vacinas, como Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Astrazeneca e o Butantã.

Por fim, esperamos que a mesma inspire trabalhos futuros a aprimorar os métodos que propusemos, bem como as técnicas existentes, com o objetivo de expandir ainda mais o domínio de novas bases teóricas no campo da simulação pandêmica computacional. Podendo contribuir para o desenvolvimento de estratégias mais eficazes de prevenção e resposta a pandemias no futuro, por exemplo, através do uso de aprendizado de máquina sobre os cenários simulados, elevando, ainda mais, as conclusões a serem tomadas sobre o decorrer de uma pandemia.
