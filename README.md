This repository contains every piece of code related to our final thesis at the Technical High School of Campinas: "Virtual simulation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Campinas using cellular automata: investigating the effectiveness of social isolation and vaccination measures".

The goal of the project is
```
Create an effective pandemic simulation model that is capable of minimizing the impact of possible
future pandemics by creating different scenarios that act as awareness raisers for competent entities
and for the population to act preventively in the midst of a potential pandemic.
```

The project was developed with _Typescript_ to create simulation logic and _Python_ for data analysis. To decide the main language, several performance tests were carried out using the following languages: <br/> <br/>
